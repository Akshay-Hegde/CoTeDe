CoTe De l'eau
=====

The full name of this package is CoTe De l'eau, which I understand
in my poor french to the something near to "rating the water". The
short name is cotede, to make easier for the users to remember,
since it is the quality control of COnductivity TEmperature and
DEpth (cotede).

This package is intended to quality control CTD stations by applying
a sequence of tests. It uses the PyCNV package to interpret the
SeaBird's .cnv output file.

This the result from several generations of quality control systems,
which started in 2006, while I was in charge of the quality control
of termosalinographs at AOML-NOAA, USA. Later I was advising the
quality control of the brazilian hydrography of PIRATA.

The tests implemented so far are just the traidional ones. When I
have a chance, I'll implement a new generation system that I've been
thinking about.
